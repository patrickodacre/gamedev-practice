# Gamedev Practice

This is a place where I test out different things to help me learn programming games from scratch.

If you enjoy programming games by hand be sure to subscribe to my [YouTube channel - Handmade Games](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKXSHFNc-5D9i3heHkHgeUg) - to connect. I'd love to hear from you!
